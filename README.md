# MidiAngelo Project

Project MidiAngelo

A website which converts user generated drawings into music

You will have a canvas to draw whatever you want

Once you finish drawing, you hit the convert button and you will have your music based on your drawing. 

You can also add other instruments to your music file once it is converted. There is a wide range of instruments available.
